chunks
adjacent method was slower because all the threads were reading and writing to the same cache line
this means that every time a thread completes its calculations and writes back to memory, it invalidates all the other threads caches
When this happens the modified cache needs to write back to memory and the invalid caches need to read from memory.
This creates a huge bottleneck and loss of performance.

The chunks method on the other hand could potentially performs very well if the chunks were wide enough that every thread reads and writes to a different cache line
